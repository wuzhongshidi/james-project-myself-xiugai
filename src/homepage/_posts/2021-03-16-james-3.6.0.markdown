The Apache James developers are pleased to announce James server 3.6.0 release.

Early adopters can [download it][download], any issue can be reported on our issue [tracker][tracker].

## Announcements

### Experimental support for JMAP RFC-8621 and deprecation of JMAP Draft

Since the last release we worked hard refreshing our JMAP implementation, implementing both [JMAP core][jmap-core],
[JMAP mail][jmap-mail] and the [JMAP over WebSocket][jmap-ws] specifications. Their support is considered experimental and
early adopters' feedback is highly welcomed.

[JMAP Draft][jmap-draft] should be considered legacy, and will be removed in upcoming 3.7.0 release.

### Switch to Java 11 for build and run

We adopted Java Runtime Environment 11 from James release 3.6.0. James 3.5.0 is the last version offering Java Runtime
Environment 8 support.

### Changed
- Switch to Java 11 for build and run

- JAMES-2046 SentDateComparator should fallback to Mimle4J parsers
- JAMES-3416 ElasticSearch address indexing fixes
- JAMES-3386 add test to ensure blank mailbox paths are not allowed in jmap draft
- MAILBOX-392 WebAdmin documentation: creation of mailboxes with '&' is allowed
- JAMES-3380 use non am/pm dependent hour format
- JAMES-2220 JMAP Draft: Flags update should not fail when a user is missing its Outbox

- JAMES-3201 ReIndexing enhancements
- JAMES-3179 Fix UpdatableTickingClock thread safety issue
- MAILBOX-405 Renaming too much mailboxes at once was failing on top of the Cassandra mailbox

### Removed
- HybridBlobStore. Introduced to fasten small blob access, its usage could be
compared to a cache, but with a sub-optimal implementation (no eviction, default replication factor, no  circuit breaking).
Use BlobStore cache instead.

### Performance
- JAMES-3295 Multiple IMAP performance enhancements for the Distributed Server. Some enhancement might transfer to other servers as well.
  - JAMES-3295 Use MessageManager::listMessagesMetadata more widely (IMAP)
  - JAMES-3265 IMAP FETCH reading lastUid and lastModseq should be optional
  - JAMES-3265 CassandraMessageMapper should limit modseq allocation upon flags updates
  - JAMES-3265 Impement a MessageMapper method to reset all recents
- JAMES-3263 Optimize RecipientRewriteTable::getMappingsForType
- JAMES-3458 Limit Cassandra statements when retrieving all quota limits
- JAMES-2037 CassandraMessageMapper::listAllMessageUids should not rely on ComposedMessageIdWithMetaData
- JAMES-3453 Specify explicitly lower safer defaults for Reactor flatMaps, filterWhens
- JAMES-3444 Allow moving JMAP mailets in a local-delivery processor - this enables calling `RecipientIsLocal` only one time in the mailet processing pipeline.
- JAMES-2037 Use Flux for MessageManager::search
- JAMES-3409 Better denormalize mailboxes within the Distributed Server. This enables reading only one table of the projection instead of two. Read repairs are implemented for keeping eventual consistency checks. Read upgrade instructions.
- JAMES-3433 Distributed Server: use caching blobstore only for frequently accessed data (callers can specify the level of performance they expect). This ensures the cache is read when it is useful.
- JAMES-3408 Limit concurrency when retrieving mailbox counters
- JAMES-3430 Restructure message properties storage within Cassandra Mailbox. See upgrade instructions.
- JAMES-3277 SetMessagesUpdateProcessor should read less mailboxes - enhance performance for JMAP-draft and JMAP RFC-8621.
- JAMES-3408 Enforce IMAP List not reading counters for Distributed James
- JAMES-3377 Remove unused text criterion - newly indexed mails indexed in ElasticSearch will take less space
- JAMES-3095 Avoid listing all subscriptions for each mailbox (IMAP)
- JAMES-2629 Use a future supplier in CassandraAsyncExecutor
- JAMES-2904 Avoid loading attachment when not needed (IMAP & JMAP) + attachment content streaming (JMAP)
- JAMES-3155 Limit the number of flags updated at the same time
- JAMES-3264 MAILBOX details are read 3 times upon indexing
- JAMES-3506 Avoid a full body read within VacationMailet
- JAMES-3508 Improved performance for IMAP APPEND
- JAMES-3506 SMTP performance enhancement
- JAMES-3505 Make mail remote delivery multi-threaded
- JAMES-3488 Support TLS 1.3
- JAMES-3484 Cassandra mailbox should group copies/moves

### Third party softwares
- James is no longer tested against Cassandra 3.11.3 but instead against Cassandra 3.11.10. Users are recommended to upgrade to this
version as well. See related upgrade instructions.

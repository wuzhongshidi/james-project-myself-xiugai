=== ToPlainText

This mailet converts HTML parts of a message into Plain text.

It starts looking for multipart/alternative containing a text/plain and a text/html part
and only keep the text/plain part. Then in a second pass replaces remaining text/html by
their textual content, infered by parsing the HTML content and handling common tags.

Eg:

----
<mailet matcher="All" class="ToPlainText"/>
----

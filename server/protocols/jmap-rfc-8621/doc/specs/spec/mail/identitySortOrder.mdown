# Identity sort order

> :information_source:
> Implemented

### urn:apache:james:params:jmap:mail:identity:sortorder

This represents support for the extra `sortOrder` property on the `Identity` object.

Servers supporting this specification MUST add this property to the capabilities object.

This extension is specific to the Apache James server and is a temporary solution while waiting for the main work on
Identity sort order as part of the IETF group to be finalized as a proper RFC document.

### Additions to the Identity object

This specification adds the following property on `Identity` object:

- **sortOrder**: `UnsignedInt` (default: 0)  Defines the sort order of Identities when presented in the clientâ€™s UI, so
it is consistent between devices. The number MUST be an integer in the range 0 <= sortOrder < 2^31.
